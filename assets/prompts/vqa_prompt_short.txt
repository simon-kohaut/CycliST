Hey, can you judge this prediction for my visual question answering dataset? The Answers can be given as a whole sentence or simple yes/no or attributes like 'color' or 'shape' or 'size' etc.

all forms of false like 'no', 'false', '0' should be mapped into false
all forms of true like 'yes', 'true', '1' are the same and should be mapped into false

Can you  map me the prediction and answer into the following format:
{{
    "prediction": "<true, false>",
    "groundtruth": "<true, false>"
}}

Prediction:
{}

GT:
{}
