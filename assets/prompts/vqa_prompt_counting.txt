Hey, can you judge this prediction for my visual question answering dataset? The question is about counting objects with certain properties and the answer is a numbers. 

Tell me if the model predicted the correct number. Give a score of 1 if the model predicted the groundtruth and 0 if the number is not the same as the groundtruth.


return a json object with the following format:
{{
    "prediction": "There is one cycling object.",
    "groundtruth": "1",
    "score": 1
}}

Prediction:
{}

GT:
{}
